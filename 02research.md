  <li><h4><i>Optimal Job Design and Information Elicitation</i></h4>
  <p>with <i><b>Arijit Mukherjee</b></i> and <i><b>Luis Vasconcelos</b></i></p></li>
  
  <p><b>Abstract: </b>
Managers often rely on their subordinates for local information that aids
decision-making but cannot commit to a decision rule. When the firm and the
workers have conflicting interests on how such information gets used,
incentives for effort and information elicitation become intertwined. We
explore how this incentive problem may be solved through job design---the
choice between "individual assignment"
where all tasks in a given job are assigned to the same worker, and
"team assignment" where the tasks are
split among a group. Team assignment facilitates information elicitation but
suffers from "diseconomies of scope" in
incentive provision. This tradeoff drives the optimal job design, and it is
shaped by two key parameters---the workers' ex-ante likelihood of being
informed and the noise in the performance measure that is used to reward the
worker. Individual assignment is optimal when the performance measure is
well-aligned, but team is optimal when the measure is noisy and the workers
are highly likely to be informed about the local conditions.   </p></ul>

<li><h4><i>Assimilation with Different Working Skill Acquisition</i></h4></li>
<p> <b>Abstract: </b>Discrimination have different forms across places with variety of population composition. 
  We construct a two-stage assimilation model to analyze the discrimination level in groups with different discount factors. 
  I have three main results: 
  First, there always exist an equilibrium for any discount factors and minority group size, the equilibrium will have a on-path action profile with a cutoff rule; 
  second, as group size increase, both discrimination level and the ability cutoff will increase; 
  third, when discount factors varies across different regimes, the effect is not monotonic.</p></ul>

<li><h4><i>The market of good with multiple attributes</i></h4></li>
<p> <b>Abstract: </b>In many cases, products have multiple attributes and but consumers can only leanr the overall quality but not quality of each attribute. 
In this article, we explore the following question: assuming that the previous consumers always file sincere report, do the future consumers learn faster or slower when the product has more
attributes? I find that when the degree of variation in the seller’s (ex-ante) types is
high, consumers will learn faster when the product has more attributes than fewer attributes.
On the other hand, when the degree of variation in seller’s (ex-ante) types is low, the opposite
is true.</p></ul>


<h2>Working Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><h4><i>Contest with Valuation associated with Population Uncertainty</i></h4></li>
<p> <b>Abstract: </b>This paper examines contests with population uncertainty and the value of the prize depend on the number of players. I find that when the value of the prize increases as the number of players increases, the players tend to exert more effort, and when the value of prize decreases as the number of players increase, the players tend to exert less effort.</p></ul>
